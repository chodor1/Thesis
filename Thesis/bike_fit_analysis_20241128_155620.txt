AI Recommendations:
**Biomechanical Analysis:**

* **Knee Angle:**
  * Indicates excessive knee flexion during the pedal stroke.
* **Hip Angle:**
  * Insufficient hip flexion, resulting in reduced power generation.
* **Elbow Angle:**
  * Optimal for comfort and efficiency.
* **Shoulder Angle:**
  * Within the optimal range for maintaining upper body rigidity.
* **Torso Angle:**
  * Slightly above the ideal range, which can increase lower back strain.
* **Knee Extension:**
  * Excessive knee extension, indicating overextension and potential knee pain.

**Potential Issues with Current Position:**

* Reduced power output due to insufficient hip flexion.
* Lower back discomfort due to increased torso angle.
* Increased risk of knee pain from excessive extension.

**Specific Adjustments Needed:**

* Raise the saddle height to increase hip flexion.
* Lower the handlebars slightly to reduce torso angle.
* Adjust the cleat position to reduce knee extension.

**Risk of Injury Assessment:**

* Increased risk of knee pain due to excessive extension.
* Potential for lower back strain from prolonged riding in a non-optimal torso position.

**Performance Optimization Suggestions:**

* Improving hip flexion will enhance power output.
* Reducing torso angle will improve comfort and reduce strain on the lower back.
* Optimizing knee extension will prevent knee pain and improve pedal efficiency.
